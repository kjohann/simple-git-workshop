# Git Workshop

This is a very simple "follow along" or do by your self type of workshop for some handy git tips and tricks.

## What You'll Learn

- Git configuration and aliases
- Cross-platform Git practices
- Branch management and rebasing
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Interactive rebase workflows
- Rerere (Reuse Recorded Resolution)

## Prerequisites

- **Git**: Is there any reason to not have the latest?
  - Check: `git --version`
  - Install: [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher
  - Check: `node --version`
  - Install: [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Basic Git Knowledge**: Familiarity with commits, branches, and basic commands
- *Optional*: A fear of rebasing and/or using git from the terminal :ghost:

## Setup

You'll need to clone the repo to do the tasks. I personally recommend using the GitHub CLI as that also comes with a lot of handy commands to integrate into your workflow using git with GitHub. But any way of cloning or downloading the source code is fine.

After cloning simply do the following:

```bash
cd simple-git-workshop
npm install
```

## Workshop structure

Each task is an independent exercise. Run the setup script, navigate into the task directory, and follow the instructions:

```bash
# Set up Task 1
npm run task:1

# Navigate to the task directory
cd task1

# Read the instructions
cat Instructions.md  # or open in your editor

# Complete the exercises, then return to workshop root
cd ..
```

If you want to reset a task you can run the setup with the `--force` flag:

```bash
npm run task:1 -- --force
```

Each task setup will give you a folder named after the task that contains a separate git repo. There may be some history there generated by the script. Whenever the script generates files that are only there to add some history to the git repo, those files are put in the `_sample` directory.

**You don't need to look at these files.**
